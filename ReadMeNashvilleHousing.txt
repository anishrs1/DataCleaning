This is a data cleaning project for the Nashville Housing Dataset, which contains information like home address, 
year the house was built, owner name, legal references and tax district. The purpose of this project is to
reorganize the entire dataset table to make it perfectly ripe for data analysis. To do that, we performed
actions like standardizing the date format, splitting the property address information like city name and zip code,
removing duplicate values and deleting unused columns that were irrelevant for the data analysis. 
This data cleaning was done using SQL code.
